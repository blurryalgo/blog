Travel is a gift that lets us escape our daily routines, leaving behind the familiar
to embrace the unknown. Stepping away from the usual nuisances and mundane realities
allows us to gain new perspectives and experiences that enrich our lives.

I was fortunate enough to seize such an opportunity when a colleague suggested a trek
to the majestic Chandrashila peak in Uttarakhand, India. As an avid trekker, the mere
thought of this adventure filled me with exhilaration. There was no way I could let this
chance slip by; my passion for trekking runs deep, and I was determined to savor every
moment amidst the stunning mountains.

Having previously trekked in Himachal Pradesh, this journey marked my first time
exploring the trails of Uttarakhand. It was exciting to explore a new place and
experience trekking in this beautiful region for the first time.

Overall, it was an opportunity for me to shed the burdens of the regular routines
and rediscover what's essential through effort, isolation, spirituality and proximity
to nature's grandeur. Such travels can leave you shifted in perspective and priorities.

Our adventure began with an exciting trip to Saari village, the starting point for
our four-day trek. A group of about 15 excited faces, we set off from
Mohali in the middle of the night, boarding a train that would take us to the doorstep
of nature's beauty.

After a night filled with anticipation, we arrived in Rishikesh at dawn, the busy
gateway to the Himalayas. Though still a bit sleepy, we were invigorated by the
adventure that awaited us.

From Rishikesh, we found a vehicle to take us to Saari Village. Along the way, we were
mesmerized by the spectacular confluence at Devprayag, where the Bhagirathi and Alaknanda
rivers merge to form the sacred Ganges. This sight, rich with cultural and spiritual
significance, reminded us of the sacredness of the land we were about to explore. The
peaceful flow of the rivers and the surrounding natural beauty filled us with awe and reverence.

As we drove along winding roads, each turn revealed stunning views. Tall mountains
bathed in the morning sun, and lush forests whispered ancient secrets. The fresh
mountain air filled our lungs, making us feel calm and excited for the adventures ahead.

Saari village greeted us warmly, its simple charm and rustic beauty quickly winning
our hearts. Nestled in green valleys and surrounded by towering peaks, the village
felt peaceful and welcoming. The friendly locals and the beautiful surroundings made
us feel at home, setting the perfect scene for the epic journey we were about to begin.

Eager for a fresh adventure, I rose early, thrilled to set out for Deoriatal Lake.
For some of us, it was our first morning in the mountains of Uttarakhand, but the
excitement was equally high for all. After a hearty breakfast, we packed our bags
and began our trek from Saari village to the enchanting Deoriatal Lake.

The hike took us around 3-4 hours and, though it was quite tiring, the journey was
incredibly rewarding. The trail was adorned with beautiful red flowers, casting a
magical vibe that kept our spirits high. We couldn't resist stopping to capture
the breathtaking scenery, and we found a quaint café along the way that was perfect
for a quick break and some memorable photographs.

However, in my excitement, I left my jacket at the café. It wasn’t until we were
nearly at our destination that I realized my mistake. Reluctantly, I trekked back
to retrieve it. Despite the setback, this gave me an opportunity to interact with
several other travelers, including many foreigners, who were also on their way to the lake.

Finally, I reached Deoriatal Lake, and the sight was worth every step. The serene
lake, surrounded by dense trees and towering mountains, was a scene of pure tranquility.
As someone who loves sitting by the water, I found this place to be a perfect spot to unwind.
We spent hours there, simply sitting by the lake and talking, soaking in the natural beauty
and peaceful atmosphere.

## Trekking to Chopta

> Conquered four mountains in a single day

After spending a beautiful night in the mountains, we woke up refreshed and ready for our
next checkpoint - Chopta. The journey offered two options: reach there by vehicle or
embrace the old-fashioned way. As true adventurers, we, of course, chose the latter.

Our adventure began around 8 AM, right after we witnessed a glorious sunrise and enjoyed
a hearty breakfast. The morning air was crisp and invigorating, perfect for the journey ahead.

As we started our trek, the excitement was palpable. The path wound through the lush landscape,
inviting us to explore its every turn. It wasn’t long before we found ourselves stopping frequently,
not because we were tired, but because the views were simply irresistible. Each spot seemed more
beautiful than the last, and we couldn’t help but capture these moments with our cameras.

Despite the beauty surrounding us, the trek was not without its challenges. The climb was
demanding, and our legs soon began to feel the strain. We took several breaks, where some of
us would sit and rest. I had set a personal challenge for myself: not to sit unless it was
absolutely necessary. So, while my friends rested, I stood, enjoying the scenery and pushing
myself to keep going.

We continued this way, stopping only for lunch, which we had packed from our tent. Sitting
down to eat was a welcome respite, giving us the energy we needed to continue. The trek was
about 16 kilometers in total, and as we moved forward, the landscape continued to amaze us.

At one point, we encountered massive mountains that looked like dormant volcanoes, their
imposing forms adding a sense of awe to our journey. The path ahead resembled a vast garden,
adorned with vibrant red flowers that seemed to stretch endlessly.

The real surprise came when we encountered patches of snow. It was the first time we encountered
snow on this trip, and it added a magical touch to our adventure. The contrast of the white snow
against the green and red landscape was stunning.

Our journey also led us to a river nestled between two mountains. We paused here to fill our
water bottles, the cool, fresh water revitalizing us. Crossing the river was a delightful
experience, adding to the sense of adventure that had defined our trek.

In total, we crossed four mountains that day. Each ascent and descent brought new challenges
and rewards, making the journey as thrilling as it was exhausting.

When we finally reached Chopta, we were all elated, though undeniably tired. The sense of
accomplishment was profound, and all we wanted to do was rest. The trek had been long and
arduous, but the memories we made and the sights we saw were worth every step.

We settled into our resting spot, content and happy. The journey to Chopta had been an
adventure filled with breathtaking views, personal challenges, and unforgettable moments.
As we rested, we couldn’t help but look back on the day with smiles on our faces, already
cherishing the memories we had created.

Picture this: It’s 3 AM, and we're gearing up for the adventure of a lifetime - hiking up the
Chandrashila peak in Uttarakhand. Yup, you heard that right! It was one of the most beautiful
treks I've ever done.

So, there we were, starting our trek in the dead of night. But guess what? The moon was
showing off, casting this mystical glow on everything around us. The snow looked like it was
studded with diamonds, shimmering under the moonlight.

As we ascended higher, the landscape transformed into a winter wonderland, with snow
blanketing the rugged terrain. Thanks to the trusty spikes adorning our shoes, it kept us
from slipping and sliding all over the place.

After what felt like forever (but was totally worth it), we reached Tungnath temple.
It was like stumbling upon a hidden gem in the middle of nowhere. We took a breather,
said a little prayer for good measure, and then it was back to business - conquering
Chandrashila!

With each step, the ascent grew steeper, demanding every ounce of our strength and
determination. Yet, as we stood atop the peaks of Chandrashila, the sense of accomplishment
eclipsed any fatigue. The view was out of this world! Surrounded by the mountains, and we were
right in the middle of it all. We had a furry friend tagging along from Tungnath.
Talk about squad goals!
